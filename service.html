<h1>Tourism and travel-related services</h1>
<h2>Nearly all WTO members emphasize the importance of tourism, especially in terms of its contribution to employment and generating foreign exchange. Typically one of the most dynamic economic sectors, tourism-related services are labour-intensive, with numerous links to other major segments of the economy.
Tourism and travel-related services includes services provided by hotels and restaurants (including catering), travel agencies and tour operator services, tourist guide services and other related services.
One of the most crucial aspects of international tourism is the cross-border movement of consumers. This permits even unskilled workers in remote areas to become services exporters — for instance, by selling craft items, performing in cultural shows, or working in a tourism lodge.
</h2>
<h1>Developments in the sector</h1>
<h2>According to the World Tourism Organization, international tourist arrivals reached 1.23 billion in 2016, up strongly from 674 million in 2000. Earnings reached a record US$ 1.22 trillion, increasing impressively from US$ 495 billion in 2000. Receipts from international passenger transport (i.e. visitor exports) were estimated at US$ 216 billion in 2016, bringing total international tourism receipts to US$ 1.4 trillion, corresponding to almost US$ 4 billion per day.
International tourist arrivals are expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030, according to the UNWTO’s long-term forecast. Arrivals in emerging destinations are expected to increase at twice the rate of those in advanced economies (4.4% versus 2.2% annually, respectively). Market share of emerging economies has grown from 30% in 1980 to 45% in 2016, and is expected to reach 57% by 2030, equivalent to over 1 billion international tourist arrivals.
</h2>
<h1>Current commitments and exemptions</h1>
